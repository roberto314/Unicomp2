Apple I Replica.
patched code changes PIA Address from D0F2 to D012 because an address range from D010 to D0FF won't work with
unicomp version 1. This is the same as BRIELBASIC config in a1basic.asm line 144-147.
D010 to D0FF works and this should be the correct range for this replica.
Programs:
Load program (.ucb file) with ./UC_fill_RAM.py write memory_test.ucb
and start with 280R.
For Basic programs go to BASIC without clearing RAM = warmstart (E2B3R).
There one can LIST or RUN.
To find out if a program is BASIC or machine Language look at the load address. A load address of 0x280 or 0x300 suggests a 
machine language program, 0x800 sugests a BASIC program.
