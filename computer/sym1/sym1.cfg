[modifications]
text = '''
cpu: install MOS 6502
ramrom: install MOS 6532 in Place #0
parallel: install 6532, connect /RS from 6532 to +5V, PB7 is RX, 
PB4 is TX (inverted Logic Level serial) - use inverters to buffer and Level shift. 
Baud can be 4800 or 9600 depending on ROM. Start Basic with G C000, RAE with G B000.
start picocom -b 4800 /dev/ttyS4.
